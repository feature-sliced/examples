## solidjs-with-layout

This example shows how to work with layout (or layouts). Split layout to dumb component (with markup) and smart component for widget compositions. Dumb layout can be placed in `@shared/ui/Layout`, smart - `@app/layouts/BaseLayout.tsx`. See [`@app/layouts/baseLayout.tsx`](./src/app/layouts/BaseLayout.tsx) and [`@shared/ui/Layout/*`](./src/shared/ui/Layout) in code.
